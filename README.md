# Road Image Classification
I wrote a little python program to train a multi-task model for road classification from satellite imagery. Mutli-task learning acts as a regularizer and can lead to improved performance. I was able to gather labeled data for training and testing from a link posted in the code (check it out - it's an interesting exercise).
